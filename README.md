# Project planning

For project requirements and project planning I followed the agile methodologies and best practices. I used a scrum board which is a built in feature in the projects repository with GitHub. 

Please click the [link](https://github.com/users/Christoph33one/projects/30/views/1) to view the project Kanban board

I created a list of project goals using agile user stories method. A user Story is a small, self-contained unit of development work designed to accomplish a specific goal within a product and articulate the value proposition for the work and drive the development work. 

With agile it is advised to use a team velocity approach. Team velocity represents how many story points the development team can manage to finish in one iteration of a particular length.

As I am the only one planning this project and not using a team, I will not be using the team velocity approach and point score system.

Using agile's MOSCOW method, each user story has been highlighted with the importance of the projects acceptance criteria. I used labels to indicate the importance of each user story and it's involvment with the project.

# Data structure
Data Structure (models)
All of the data structuring was completed when creating my backend API. The repository and accompanying README can be found here: Click [here](https://github.com/Christoph33one/post-planner-api/blob/main/assets/data%20structure%20.png) to view.

# Authentication
To fully utilize the features of this site, users are required to register. The Navbar provides easy access to the registration form, where users can create a username, set a password, and confirm it by re-entering it.

Please note that all registration fields must be filled out before the registration process can be completed. The registration form incorporates built-in error handling to ensure that users cannot register without providing all the required information.

### Navigation 
To provide users with a seamless and modern browsing experience, I have incorporated a simple yet effective navigation menu at the top of the website, which is displayed consistently across all pages. This feature allows users to easily access essential pages such as the Home page, Locations page, Sign Up, Sign In, and Sign Out, without having to search for them.

Moreover, to enhance the user's sense of personalization, I have implemented a unique feature in the Navigation bar. When users are signed in, they can view their login name prominently displayed on the Navigation bar, providing a sense of ownership and recognition to the user. This small yet significant touch adds a personal touch and makes the user feel valued, thereby improving their overall browsing experience.

Font family used for H1 - Oswald "regular 400" 

Default setting - "sans serif"

Font family used for H3, H4 & P - Roboto"light 300"

Defaul setting - "sans serif"

All icons are taken from an open source - [Font awesome ](https://fontawesome.com/)

# Colour scheme 

All colours where picked with design industry colours which are trusted within communities of website design. I used an Wilderness colour plate in Adobe Color Wheel. using shades of blue  are used. For when using the shade of black I used #0D0D0D. This shade gives a deeper colour and more detail to text.

The reason I have not used many colours, is for the images to produce the colour to the site. As the images are full of colour, I wanted them to stand out and make an impression to the user.

All colours are taken from an open source - [Adobe Color Wheel ](https://color.adobe.com/trends/Wilderness?page=4)

# Bugs
### Navbar
ERROR
In the NavBar component, when passing the expanded prop to the Navbar component, you are assigning the setExpanded function instead of the expanded state value. The correct code should be:

PASS ERROR
Passed expanded prop to the navabr component

### Post Page 
ISSUE:
Data base not being updated. Error 400 in the console.

SOLUTION:
After reviewing the Network in the console, I could read that the Error was that I did not add the locations field from the api model as an object and call it the in useState Hook. Once adding this, all data was being saved in the database.

ISSUE:
When implementing the search feature to allow users to search for travel plans by location, I encountered an error in the PostsPage function. Despite using the filter method and a try-catch block with axiosReq (request) to fetch data from the travelplanposts/ URL, the posts data was not being displayed on the /locations page.

SOLUTION:
Upon reviewing the API for fetching the posts data, I discovered a typing error in the URL within the catch block. This mistake prevented the data from being fetched, causing the spinner component to continue running without rendering any results. After correcting the typing error, the posts data was successfully rendered on the page.

### MoreDropDown component
ISSUE:
While implementing the handleDelete prop into the onClick function within the return statement of the MoreDropdown component, I encountered difficulty in getting the delete function to successfully delete a post associated with the current user.

SOLUTION:
Upon careful examination, I identified a typing error within the handleDelete prop when it was used inside the onClick function. After correcting the value, I performed a test and confirmed that the delete function is now functioning properly.

### PostEditFrom page
ISSUE: While implementing the edit function for users to update their travel plans, I encountered a problem where a single image would not update correctly. Instead, I was redirected to the page with the original image.

SOLUTION:
Upon testing, I found that I could only update all the images at once and not a single image. This issue was down to having the if statement that checks the condition was wraped around all the image files to be appended. To address this, I restructured the if statement to apply to each image individually. After conducting further tests, I am now able to successfully update a single image.

### Travel post page
ISSUE: When implementing comments, I used the map method to iterate over the comments results. However, when running the project in the browser, a blank page was displayed.

SOLUTION: Upon reviewing the error in the console, I realized that I was mistakenly mapping over the incorrect value of results. After correcting the value, the page rendered correctly.

### ProfilePage

Issue:

While attempting to render all posts by a user from their profile page, I encountered a problem where the page would appear blank and an error would be logged in the console for fetchMoreData.

Solution:
Upon reviewing the console error, I identified a type error in the hasMore={!!profilePosts.next} code. It was discovered that I had removed the second exclamation mark (!), which resulted in the incorrect rendering of images within fetchMoreData. By rectifying this issue, the images were displayed correctly.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for React apps on the Codeanywhere IDE. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **19th April, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the required npm packages.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open port 3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
